This is a simple and fun Python script that rotates your screen by 360 degrees in 90-degree increments. It loops five times, rotating the screen every second, creating a playful visual effect. It's intended as a lighthearted prank or experiment to surprise friends or test display behaviors.

Language Used:
Python

Libraries Used:
- rotatescreen (to control screen orientation)
- time (to add delay between rotations)

Note:
- This app is designed for **Windows systems**.
- The `rotatescreen` library must be installed (`pip install rotate-screen`).
- Use with cautionâ€”excessive screen rotation may confuse some users or interfere with open applications.
